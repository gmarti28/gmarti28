This is not my main github account. 

Back in 2019 I've used this account for contributing in an enterprise repository which is private. So my heatmap reflects that activity back in 2019.

Other accounts that I own

 - [gaston-martin](https://github.com/gaston-martin)  (My main account)
 - [gastonmartin77](https://github.com/gastonmartin77) (An account I've used for contributing in a private repository in the past, that I'm still struggling to recover so my heatmap is updated for such private contributions.
